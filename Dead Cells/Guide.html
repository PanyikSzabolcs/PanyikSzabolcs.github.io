            Dead Cells is described as a "roguevania", a combination of procedurally-generated roguelike games and action-exploration-based Metroidvania games. The player controls a mass of cells that occupy and control the body of a deceased prisoner at the start of each game. As they explore a series of dungeons and fight the creatures within, they collect weapons, skins, abilities, power-ups, and money. Enemies will sometimes drop cells when defeated, which can be used to obtain permanent power-ups such as additional health potions or items that can be bought or found in later runs. These cells must be spent at the end of a dungeon section; if a player dies before then, they lose all collected cells.
            
            Each level is procedurally generated by merging of predesigned sections in a random configuration along with random placement of enemies and items. The game's combat is compared to the Souls series, with difficult enemies with certain behaviors the player can learn, and where frequent player-character death is a fundamental part of the game. At intervals throughout the game, the player must defeat boss enemies known as "Keepers". There are eight Keepers in the gameâ€”The Concierge, Conjunctivius, Mama Tick, The Scarecrow, The Time Keeper, The Giant, The Hand of the King, and The Collector.
            
            The game includes Twitch integration, allowing viewers, via the stream's chat, to influence the game, such as voting for which upgrade paths the player should take.
